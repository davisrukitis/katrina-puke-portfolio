            My name is Katrīna Puķe, and I’m an emerging multimedia artist and graphic designer from Riga, Latvia. I graduated from the Riga School of Design and Art as an Advertising Design Specialist and am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Visual Communication at the Latvian Academy of Arts, specializing in the Audio-Visual department.

          <p className="text-lg mb-6 inter">
            My passion for art began at the age of six when I first attended the Design and Art School of Valmiera in the "Visual Plastic Arts" program. It was there that I started developing my artistic abilities and creative vision through academic painting, drawing, and sculpting.

            With a diverse background in art and design, I’ve had the privilege of working with design and advertising agencies such as Element Digital in Riga. I also interned as a pavilion assistant at the prestigious Venice Biennale of Architecture and am currently gaining experience as a marketing and content manager at the Tallinas Street Creative Quarter.

            I’m proficient in Adobe Creative Cloud, with expertise in Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. My skills extend to video editing using software like DaVinci Resolve and include foundational knowledge of 3D design and animation as well as virtual reality expiriences developed through tools like Blender and Unity.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-10 inter">
            My creative work has been featured in exhibitions such as “Rakstatsevišķi” in 2023, and my screen print pieces have been showcased at the annual “Jaunmarka” student art exhibition at the Latvian Academy of Arts for several years.
